To support my application for the Hockey R&D Fellowship, Iâ€™ve been working on this project to test out an idea I have for boosting secondary scoring. I think that using an 11-7 lineup could help the Penguins get their top forwards more ice time, where they tend to thrive, while also giving a lift to the rest of the forward group. The Lightning use this setup with success, and I believe it could work here.


The offical game sheets were used to collect scores, TOI, Goals, Assists, Points, +/-, SOG, Shot Attempts Blocked, Missed Shots, Hits, Giveaways, Takeaways, Blocked Shots, and Faceoffs.

All other stats were collected via MoneyPuck.com
